Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

It takes more time to run more simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 100000 simulation, since if the charge is placed upon seconds then it would save money by stopping before 1000000 so 5 simulations would be okay
